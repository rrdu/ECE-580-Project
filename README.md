# ECE-580-Project

This is the Github Repository for our group's ECE 580 (Spring 2025) final project. 

## Project Overview:
Our project aims to tackle the issue of **identifying fake news from real news** by comparing the performance of various machine learning models and preprocessing functions on real and fake political news articles.

## Group Members:
- Rebecca Du (rrd17)
- Anish Parmar (avp30)
